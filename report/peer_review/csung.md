My presentation comments:

- Need to be explicit in the report on the algorithm parameters used and why (even if just arbitrary choices)
- Need to justify coverage metric
- Sim seems to tend to make lots of small clusters - did you also see variations in the number of flocking clusters with parameters? Maybe you can define a metric for this. I assume there is an inverse relationship between # flocks and coverage.
