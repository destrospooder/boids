This project implements and optimizes the Boids algorithm for distributed robotic coverage tasks. The author systematically tunes the core behavioral parameters (separation, alignment, cohesion) to maximize coverage efficiency across different environments using a custom simulation framework.

Strengths:
- The manuscript is very well-structured, with clear explanations of both the classic Boids model and the specific modifications for coverage optimization.
- The custom simulator is impressive in its modularity and practical design for real-time tuning and evaluation across multiple scenarios.
- The results are thoughtfully analyzed, particularly the discussion of how different gain parameters impact group exploration dynamics in cluttered environments.
- The approach to systematic random search and parallel simulation runs is efficiently implemented.

Weaknesses:
- While the environments used (empty map, corridor, cafeteria) are good initial tests, it would strengthen the study to include more randomized or larger-scale environments.
- The parameter optimization currently only targets coverage; additional objectives like overall path smoothness could be explored in future work.
- Some mathematical definitions (like forces and their scaling with acceleration budget) are clearly written, but making a summary table of all parameters and their roles could help readers keeping track of the developement.

Minor comments:
- Typo in Section 5: "coverage efficiency were achieved" â†’ should be "coverage efficiency was achieved" (agreement with singular subject).
- Some small inconsistencies in figure captions, like some figures explaining colors and some do not. But not a big deal.
