This project implements and extends Craig Reynolds' boids algorithm from the 1986 paper “Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavior Model”. The authors adapt the algorithm for robotic exploration tasks, focusing on optimizing coverage performance through parameter tuning of cohesion, alignment, and separation. The study includes a custom simulator, systematic parameter sweeps, and evaluations across three distinct environments.


Strengths:
- Clear Scope and Organization: The manuscript is well-structured, with a logical flow from problem definition to simulation, optimization, and results. The abstract and introduction succinctly outline the project’s goals and relevance to distributed robotics.

- Comprehensive Evaluation: The authors evaluate the algorithm in three environments, such as, empty map, narrow corridor, cafeteria map, each presenting unique challenges. The inclusion of coverage metrics and heatmaps provides both quantitative and qualitative insights into performance.

- Insightful Parameter Analysis: The results highlight the negative impact of excessive alignment on coverage, such as, optimal gains: near-zero alignment, moderate cohesion/separation, offering actionable insights for swarm robotics.


Weaknesses:

- Ambiguity in Simulation Modes: The transition between the interactive PyGame simulation and the headless batch-evaluation simulation is unclear. A explicit subsection or flowchart distinguishing their purposes  would improve clarity.

- Limited Environmental Complexity: While the cafeteria map tests clutter, additional dynamic factors such as wind could better assess robustness and mimic real-world situation.

- Undefined Variables: Key terms like ε for obstacle avoidance and perception radius are introduced without justification. A table summarizing parameters (e.g., bounds for k_coh, k_ali, k_col) would aid reproducibility.
